# Human Resource and Asset Management Service

This full-stack application provides a complete system for companies to
efficiently manage their workforce and company assets. The platform features
role-based access, ensuring that employees, managers, and HR administrators have
appropriate permissions. A core component is the dedicated desktop application
for attendance tracking, which simplifies the process of monitoring work hours.

## Technologies Used

The development of this e-commerce website involved the use of various
technologies and tools, including:

- **MERN Stack:** A full-stack JavaScript solution that combines MongoDB,
  Express.js, React, and Node.js to build modern, scalable web applications.
- **JWT:** Used for user authentication and managing login sessions securely.
- **Material UI:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive and
  modern user interfaces quickly.

## My Role

My responsibilities for this project were focused on ongoing maintenance and new
feature implementation. I was tasked with fixing bugs to improve the stability
and reliability of the application. I also developed and implemented a shift
tracking feature to allow managers to effectively monitor work schedules. In
addition to these key tasks, I made several other changes and enhancements
across the platform to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.
