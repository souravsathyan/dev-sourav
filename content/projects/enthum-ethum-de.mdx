# Enthum Ethum - Mobile Application

**Enthum Ethum** is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between
customers and service vendors. It enables users to easily find and connect with
professionals providing everyday services such as electrical repairs, plumbing,
and other specialized work. The app simplifies the process of hiring trusted
vendors, all from one convenient platform.

## Technologies Used

The development of this mobile application involved the use of the following
technologies and tools:

- **React Native:** Used for building a cross-platform mobile application with a
  native look and feel.
- **React Native Paper:** Provided pre-built UI components to speed up design
  and maintain consistency across the app.
- **Tanstack Query:** Efficiently managed and rendered long lists of service
  vendors, improving overall UX and performance.
- **Redux:** Handled state management, ensuring smooth data flow across
  components.
- **Razorpay API:** Integrated to support secure and seamless in-app payments
  between users and vendors.

## My Role

I was responsible for **developing this application end-to-end**, handling
everything from UI design and state management to API integration and
performance optimization. The project reflects my ability to independently
deliver a full-featured mobile experience while ensuring clean architecture and
high-quality user experience.

In conclusion, _Enthum Ethum_ delivers a streamlined experience for users to
find and hire service providers, combining performance, usability, and
reliability in one robust mobile platform.
