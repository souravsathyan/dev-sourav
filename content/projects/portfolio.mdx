# Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built to highlight my professional
journey, projects, and skills. It features a **simplistic, minimal design**
aimed at clarity and ease of navigation. The site serves as a central hub to
present my work, connect with potential collaborators or employers, and
demonstrate my capabilities as a developer.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** Used to build a fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable portfolio site.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Enabled efficient styling with a utility-first approach to
  create a clean and responsive design.

## My Role

I independently designed and developed this portfolio from scratch, focusing on
simplicity, responsiveness, and performance to effectively communicate my work
and technical expertise. I also explored various **YouTube tutorials and
developer showcases** for design and structure inspiration to help refine the
final look and feel of the website.
