# South Indian History Congress

The **South Indian History Congress** mobile application was developed to
simplify and digitize the registration and participation process for historians
across various universities. Through the app, users can register for the
upcoming SIHC event, take or renew their memberships, upload academic work, and
conveniently download their participation certificates.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:

- **React Native:** For building a cross-platform mobile application with a
  native-like experience.
- **Redux:** Used to manage and organize the application's state efficiently.
- **Native Base:** Provided consistent and reusable UI components across the
  app.

## My Role

In this project, I was responsible for:

- **Developing a multi-stage form** using a stepper interface to streamline the
  event registration process.
- **Creating the user dashboard**, allowing users to manage their membership,
  uploads, and downloads with ease.
- **Publishing the application** to both the Google Play Store and Apple App
  Store, ensuring wide accessibility across platforms.

This app offers a smooth and professional platform for academic participants to
engage with the South Indian History Congress digitally.
