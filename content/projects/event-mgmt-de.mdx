# Event Management

The **Event Management** platform is an end-to-end solution for organizing and
running events efficiently. It includes both a web interface and a mobile
application that allow users to book stalls, purchase event passes, and manage
event logistics. Admins can create gates, assign staff, and handle food services
by onboarding caterers and planning meals.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using a modern full-stack setup:

- **MERN Stack:** MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js form the core of the
  platform for building scalable web applications.
- **Redux:** Used for state management across both web and mobile apps.
- **Material UI:** Provided a responsive and visually consistent UI for the web
  interface.
- **React Native & Native Base:** Built the mobile application with a clean and
  native experience.
- **Razorpay:** Integrated for secure online transactions (handled by another
  team member).

## My Role

As a developer on this project, I contributed to both web and mobile platforms
with a focus on improving user experience and developer efficiency:

- Developed a **wizard setup** on the homepage to enable hassle-free event
  creation.
- Integrated **react-joyride** to provide a guided intro for first-time users.
- Fixed multiple bugs to improve stability.
- Re-designed the mobile UI for a more modern and engaging experience.
- Refactored and restructured the Redux setup to make the codebase cleaner and
  more developer-friendly.
